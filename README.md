These Ethereum Smart Contracts are stored as special transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain, which you can then use to build applications. You can think of smart contracts sort of like API's.
Due to smart contracts being stored on the Ethereum Blockchain, they need to be validated (or mined) like a regular transaction. Because of this, there is a small cost associated with deploying a smart contract and also altering its state. Fortunately, we will develop our smart contracts in a test environment that won't cost you a single cent - or ether.
